BUGS:

Choosing a region to search, then click Create Group: the country is remembered, but not the region.

Manage User Group
- Languages aren't pre-filled
- Address field is not user-friendly
- Culture code is not user-friendly
- Click create > language error > shows an empty UG leader DDL
- Add user username, click Add User > refreshes view and loses all entered information


TASKS:

Form patterns need to be updated to use any actual form pattern.

Data provider files need to be moved to best practice location.

Telerik controls need to be replaced with anything else.


IDEATION:

Initial page load should use geo location to determine the location of the visitor and show them UG's in their area without the need to search.

Have a setting to show the most recently created user groups, or most recently updated UG's (events, meta data, new leader, etc.) on initial page load.  (Show all anyway?)

Initial UG lists:
- My UG's
- UG's in my area
- UG's recently updated (showing type of update(s))
- UG's with upcoming meetings

Country & Region DDL's should be pre-selected based upon geo location.
